## Features
-------
- Responsive Jekyll theme
- Easy integration with Google Analytics

## Configuration
-------
- _data/info.yml
-  CNAME
	If you're using it on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, 
	you'll want to change it to be the domain you're going to use. 
	All that should be in here is a domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
-  avatar.png
	This is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's address bar. 
	You should change it to whatever you'd like.
